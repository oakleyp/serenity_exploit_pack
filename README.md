# Serenity Exploit Pack

## A multi-vulnerability, dynamically self-obfuscating, client-configurable and portable exploit kit written and released in 2012
Warning: These exploits are VERY old, however they are still live if you install and configure this application on a web server.

## How it works


## A brief history

The kit was written over the three month summer break foloowing freshman year of highschool, and released for sale on underground markets in the fall of 2012, with its last update and antivirus signature circumventions three months afterwords.

### First malware research write-up after release into the wild
Around two months after coming onto the market, an independent malware researcher found the exploit loader and circumvented what was my first attempt at a secure panel login, as documented here: 
[First malware analysis and write-up] (https://malekal.com/en-serenity-exploit-pack/)

My customer base had reached around 4 or 5 clients at this point, and total victim traffic through the kit was less than 20,000.

### Second and catastrophic researcher analysis

Around the third month, a month after recovering from the fallout of the first analysis (which meant rewriting exploits to circumvent antivirus detection), another, more thorough analysis and breakdown of the kit and its dropped binaries was released. 

I had only received one new client since the last analysis, however the change in traffic was dramatic, with the traffic having totalled nearly 500,000 victims and nearly 20,000 logged successful infections. With these statistics bringing me too close to the spotlight for the capacity of my one-man workforce, sales and updates were discontinued, and the host server was shut down.
