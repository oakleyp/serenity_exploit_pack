# Serenity Exploit Pack

## A multi-vulnerability, dynamically self-obfuscating, client-configurable and portable exploit kit written and released in 2012

Warning: These exploits are VERY old, however they are still live if you install and configure this application on a web server.

## A brief history

The kit was written over the three month summer break foloowing freshman year of highschool, and released for sale on underground markets in the fall of 2012, with its last update and antivirus signature circumventions three months afterwords.

### First malware research write-up after release into the wild
Around two months after coming onto the market, an independent malware researcher found the exploit loader and circumvented what was my first attempt at a secure panel login, as documented here: 
[First malware analysis and write-up] (https://malekal.com/en-serenity-exploit-pack/)

My customer base had reached around 4 or 5 clients at this point, and total victim traffic through the kit was less than 20,000.
